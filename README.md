# NBAShotDataAnalysis

1. Describe the dataset. (ex: The number of microaneurysms found in a patient's eye and whether or not they have diabetic retinopathy; or Lending Tree loan data, including who defaulted and who paid off their loan.) \
Data on NBA shots taken during 2014-2015 season including who took the shot, where the shot was taken, what was the distance to the nearest defender, game clock, etc.
 
2. How many records does the dataset have? \
128069
 
3. How many features does the dataset have? List or describe a few of them. \
21 \
SHOT_RESULT = whether the shot was successful \
SHOT_DIST = distance from hoop when shot was made \
SHOT_NUMBER = For this player and this match, which attempt this shot was
 
4. What can you try to predict in this dataset? (ex: We can use the number of microaneurysms measured in the patient's eye to predict whether or not they have diabetic retinopathy; or We can try using the features, including age, income, home ownership status, etc, to predict whether or not someone will default on their loan.) \
Predict whether or not a shot is made based on distance, who is shooting, where on the court is the shot being made, etc.
 
5. Is this a labeled dataset, appropriate for a supervised learning classification problem? (In other words, if you are trying to predict whether or not someone has a disease, does your dataset contain whether or not each record has the disease?) \
Yes, label is SHOT_RESULT
 
6. Provide a link to the dataset, if there is one. If you are getting your data from somewhere other than a link, where are you getting it from? \
